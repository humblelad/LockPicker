# LockPicker
Simple puzzle coded in html and css to identify and guess the random number which has been generated.

This project is coded by using around all the web technologies like html, css, js, jquery, php, ajax, mysql .

This is game where the user first registers his name which gets inserted into the database.

A random number gets generated which the user has to guess in a given no. of attempts. 

A button "All Players" helps to know all the partcipants.

A further update can be done where the db also stores the WIN / LOSE result of the player and later displays it back on the generation of the query.
